In this workshop, we will provide an overview of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology and best practices for experimental design. Participants will also explore preprocessing steps, read alignment (de novo, pseudoalignment, and to a reference genome), and differential expression analysis using DESeq2. We will also introduce tools for functional analysis and determining the biological relevance of the results.
