This workshop demonstrates how RNA data can be used for genome annotation. Participants will explore using RNA-derived evidence to improve genome annotations, distinguish coding from non-coding regions, and validate. We will also explore strategies for increasing reproducibility in bioinformatics. <!--excerpt-->
