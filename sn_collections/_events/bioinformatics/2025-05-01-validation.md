In this workshop, participants will learn how to understand and validate a genome assembly. The participants will appreciate why genome assembly is often an iterative process, where you start with a draft and constantly improve using techniques such as polishing and scaffolding. Participants will also be introduced to gene annotation. <!--excerpt-->
